# Chronix

Chronix is a natural language date parser. It is heavily inspired by [Chronic](https://github.com/mojombo/chronic).

## Installation

Until a proper Hex package is available, you can add Chronix as a dependency in your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:chronix, github: "mylanconnolly/chronix"}
  ]
end
```
